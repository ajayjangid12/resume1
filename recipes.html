<h2>Recipes - World's best scrambled eggs</h2>
<p>Chef Bill Granger says, always use a non-stick pan with a wooden spoon for best results and easy cleaning. Don't over-stir - think of theseas folded eggs rather than scrambled. The eggs should have the texture of soft curds. It's best not to cook more than three portions in one go as you will overcrowd the pan and the eggs won't cook as well. For larger numbers, cook in two pans rather than one</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 egg</li>
<li>6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk</li>
<li>1/3 cup of cream</li>
<li>A pinch of salt</li>
<li>Freshly miled black pepper</li>
<li>3 fresh chives(chopped)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instruction</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency.</li>
<li>Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Don’t allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs</li>
<li>Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan.</li>
<li>Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again</li>
<li>Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.</li>
<li>Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay</li>
</ol>
<p>you should make a <b>maximum</b> of two servings per frying pan.</p>
